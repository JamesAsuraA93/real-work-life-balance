🚀 LookAway - Quick Setup Guide
Follow these exact commands to set up your professional wellness app!

✅ Step 1: Create Folder Structure
Copy and paste these commands into Terminal:

bash
# Navigate to Desktop (or wherever you want the project)
cd ~/Desktop

# Create the complete folder structure
mkdir -p lookaway-app/src/main
mkdir -p lookaway-app/src/renderer/windows
mkdir -p lookaway-app/src/renderer/overlays
mkdir -p lookaway-app/assets/icons
mkdir -p lookaway-app/build

# Go into the project folder
cd lookaway-app
✅ Step 2: Create All Files
Now you need to create these 8 files. I'll show you the easiest way:

Using Terminal (Recommended)
bash
# Create empty files
touch package.json
touch .gitignore
touch build/entitlements.mac.plist
touch src/main/main.js
touch src/renderer/windows/settings.html
touch src/renderer/overlays/eye-rest.html
touch src/renderer/overlays/posture.html
touch README.md
Now open each file in your code editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.) and copy the content from my artifacts:

package.json ← Copy from "package.json - Professional Config"
.gitignore ← Copy from ".gitignore"
build/entitlements.mac.plist ← Copy from "build/entitlements.mac.plist"
src/main/main.js ← Copy from "src/main/main.js - Main Process"
src/renderer/windows/settings.html ← Copy from "src/renderer/windows/settings.html"
src/renderer/overlays/eye-rest.html ← Copy from "src/renderer/overlays/eye-rest.html"
src/renderer/overlays/posture.html ← Copy from "src/renderer/overlays/posture.html"
README.md ← Copy from "README.md - Complete Guide"
Using VS Code (Alternative)
bash
# Open VS Code in the project folder
code .
Then:

Click "New File" for each file listed above
Copy content from my artifacts
Save each file in the correct location
✅ Step 3: Install Dependencies
Make sure you're in the lookaway-app folder, then run:

bash
npm install
This will:

Install Electron (the desktop app framework)
Install electron-builder (for creating installers)
Create node_modules folder
Create package-lock.json file
Wait time: ~2-3 minutes depending on your internet speed

✅ Step 4: Run the App!
bash
npm start
🎉 Your app should launch!

You should see:

Settings window opens with beautiful gradient background
System tray icon appears (macOS: top-right menubar, Windows: bottom-right taskbar)
Countdown timer in macOS menubar (e.g., "60:00")
Timer starts automatically
🎮 Test the App
Test 1: Settings Window
✅ Can you see the countdown timers?
✅ Can you click Pause/Resume?
✅ Can you change the intervals?
Test 2: Minimize to Tray
✅ Click "Minimize to Tray" button
✅ Window should hide
✅ App still runs in background
Test 3: Tray Menu (Right-click the tray icon)
✅ See countdown times in menu
✅ Can pause/resume from menu
✅ Can open settings again
✅ Can quit app
Test 4: Quick Trigger (For Testing)
To test overlays immediately without waiting:

Open settings window
Set "Eye Rest" to 1 minute
Set "Posture" to 1 minute
Wait 1 minute
You should see a full-screen overlay!
🏗️ Build the Real App
Once everything works, create a standalone app:

For macOS
bash
npm run build:mac
Output location: dist/LookAway-1.0.0.dmg

To install:

Open the .dmg file
Drag LookAway to Applications folder
Launch from Applications
Important: Right-click → Open (first time only, to bypass Gatekeeper)
For Windows
bash
npm run build:win
Output location: dist/LookAway Setup 1.0.0.exe

For All Platforms
bash
npm run build:all

🔥 Pro Tips
Development Mode
While developing, use:

bash
npm start
This runs the app from source code (easier to test changes).

Debugging
Open Developer Tools:

macOS: Cmd + Option + I
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + I
You can see console logs and debug issues.

Quick Restart
After changing code:

Close the app
Run npm start again
OR press Cmd+R (Mac) / Ctrl+R (Win) to reload
Test Overlays Quickly
Set intervals to 1 minute in settings to test overlays faster!

❌ Common Issues & Fixes
Issue: "command not found: npm"
Solution: Install Node.js first
